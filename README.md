# ICS4U--Portfolio

My repository contains a website portfolio for my top 10 projects

# 1 - Microbit

The code; would generate a random number like a dice; every time we tapped on the pins. The Led would display a random number from 1-6 every time the pins were sensed an external source. 

# 2 - Cubing Hackathon
This activity was held in the library; we were showing kids how to cube; using various interactive activities.Three activities were executed which consisted of the partipants learning how to cube, and timing themselves to improve there cubing skills which ultimately helps students learn new  algorithms which vary from beginner to advanced. This was important impact on me because I learned various methods of alogirthms which relate to the concept of computer science.

# 3 - Course Algorithm App
Our group had thought of an app to help students who do not have an effective tool to study. We decided to make a flashcard app to help students. Our app called FlashTime is a more user friendly version of this concept to help students
 we had to code a front end and back end code to create the final app. The HTML and API + JS were used to code the front end. Express API and MongoDB Atlas was used to code the back end.
 Students can use FlashTime to study with flashcards they made
They can practice active-recall, which is a widely known as being an effective study method - so our app meets its purpose.

Each student also will have a username and password to keep their flashcards safe and confidential.

The image below displays our app; and as you can see a student can make multiple flashcards and it will be stored automatically.

# 4 - Creative Refractor
I created my creative refractor using open processing.When the user moves the mouse anywhere on the screen the rose pattern will continue to change into different patterns of the rose.

### Explanation of my code + What I learned from Coding challenge video
as a pair of Cartesian parametric equations of the form

If k is an integer, the curve will be rose-shaped with
When k is even, the entire graph of the rose will be traced out exactly once when the value of theta, Î¸, changes from 0 to 2 pie

This project helped me learn more about the relation between computer science and mathematics. I learned the rose is a sinusoid plotted in polar coordinates. I will continue to use math and computer science in university when I take computer science courses.


# 5 - KhanAcademy Natural Stimulation:Computational Creatures
This project is controled by the object's motion by only manipulating the acceleration. This project helped me learn about function prototype. It has made an impact me as a student because I will use this skill of creating function prototype in post secondary courses.

### Section of Code + What I learned

What I mainly learned from this project is to add a function prototype. This essentially has 4 purposes
1) It tells the return type of the data that the function will return.
2) It tells the number of arguments passed to the function.
3) It tells the data types of the each of the passed arguments.
4) Also it tells the order in which the arguments are passed to the function.


# 6 - KhanAcademy Algorithm Module: Recursive Art Project

### Section of Code 
Explained beside the line of code.

### The Outline of the Project and what I included/learned
Adding color: Various colours,  change it in some way as the function recurses.

Changing the shape: Ovals, rectangles, curves, images, alternating shapes at different levels

Using multiple recursion: Call the drawShape function multiple times inside itself, so that each level draws multiple shapes offset or rotated from one another in some way.

The algoirthm module on khan academy has taught me various concepts; for example (sorting, recursion, else of statements, calling functions) I have learned all of them from this module which will help me in the future. 



# 7 - KhanAcademy Intro to JS(Drawing & Animation): Shooting Star Project Project

## The Outline of the Project and what I included/learned
Location of canvas: where I want the star to start from, the top, bottom, left or right, and positioned my star there.

Direction: I want the star to move in. Change the variables inside draw so that the star moves the way you wanted.

Added multiple stars: I animated it going in different directions


The Intro to JS (Drawing & Animation) Module has taught me the basics of Javascript and helped me create drawings and animations. where I will learn to use further more in post secondary; in addition I plan on particpating in MLH events in the future to gain experience and use my coding skills. JavaScript module has multiple challenged that required object-oriented computer programming skills used to create interactive effects in my SHooting star projecct.

# 8 - KhanAcademy Inro to HTML/CSS: Travel Webpage Project
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55112712/73456191-74cfd680-433f-11ea-8423-19b6aeaa79b3.png)

This project taught me the basics of HTML/CSS which help me advance my skills in creating website. for example it has helped me as a student because I made a website for the girls leadership club; for when we planned a small event last year. 

# 9 - KhanAcademy Natural Stimulations: Asteroids spaceship Project
![Screenshot 2020-01-30 at 9 34 29 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55112712/73458751-bebabb80-4343-11ea-9514-e750a5576b26.png)

This project has helped me learn about forces and oscillations. I also learned matheitatical concepts that stimulate nature in my projects. I will continue to use the skills I leanred from this project as a student when I continue learning more about CS in post secondary and when I create games for future projects. 



# 10 - FreeCodeCamp Project; JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects: Palindrome Checker

This project helped me about return boolean, and I learned about true and false statements. I also learned about strings as well. This project will help me in the future; cause these skills will be used in post secondary courses.
